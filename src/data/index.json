I identified trends and patterns in historical MVP data from 2003 to 2023 and used this information to employ machine learning algorithms to build predictive models like random forest and regression models. In the end, the final model achieved an 81% prediction rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting NBA MVPs.",
